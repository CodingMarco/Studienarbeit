	abstract = {The current SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytic, Cloud) technology trend paves the way to a future
        in which intelligent machines, networked processes and big data are brought together.
        This virtual world has generated vast amount of data which is accelerating the adoption of
        machine learning solutions & practices. Machine Learning enables computers to imitate and adapt human-like behaviour.
        Using machine learning, each interaction, each action performed, becomes something the system
        can learn and use as experience for the next time. This work is an overview of this data analytics
        method which enables computers to learn and do what comes naturally to humans, i.e. learn from experience.
        It includes the preliminaries of machine learning, the definition, nomenclature and applications describing it's what,
        how and why. The technology roadmap of machine learning is discussed to understand and verify its potential
        as a market & industry practice. The primary intent of this work is to give
        insight into why machine learning is the future.
