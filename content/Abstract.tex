\section*{Abstract}
Spatio-temporal predictions have gained more and more popularity over the last few years.
Spatio-temporal neural networks have been used for many different applications,
including precipation forecasting, traffic forecasting or crime prediction.
In this work, the spatio-temporal model ConvLSTM is applied to the prediction of speed camera locations.
The model is trained and tested on a dataset covering seven years of reported speed camera locations in Germany.
